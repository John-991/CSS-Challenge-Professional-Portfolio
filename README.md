# CSS-Challenge-Professional-Portfolio

## Description
The Professional Portfolio is a meticulously crafted website that serves as a showcase of my skills and accomplishments. The primary goal was to showcase my expertise in web development, implementing advanced CSS techniques to ensure a polished, professional, and user-friendly interface.

## Distinctive webpage Features:

###  Sectional Structure:

• Divided the website into distinct segments: 'About Me,' 'My Work,' and 'Contact Info,' offering users a seamless navigation experience.

###  Functional Navigation:

• Positioned navigation links strategically to facilitate swift transitions between sections, enhancing user accessibility and fluid navigation.

###  Resume Integration:

• Included a link to a PDF version of my resume, providing supplementary information about my professional background, albeit not reflecting the most recent updates.

###  Personal Avatar Inclusion:

• Embedded an avatar photo within the interface, adding a personalized touch and establishing a connection between visitors and the digital persona.

###  My Work Showcase:

• Curated an array of projects, comprising bootcamp samples and placeholders awaiting future additions. Notably, completed projects were linked to deployed applications on GitHub, offering tangible demonstrations of work upon click.

###  Responsive Design:

• Employed advanced CSS techniques to ensure a responsive design adaptable to various screen sizes, catering to users across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

###  Hover Effects Implementation:
